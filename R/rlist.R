#' of functions that operate on non-tabular data stored in them.
#'
#' The package provides a set of functions for data manipulation with
#' list objects, including mapping, filtering, grouping, sorting,
#' updating, searching, and other useful functions. Most functions
#' are designed to be pipeline friendly so that data processing with
#' lists can be chained.
